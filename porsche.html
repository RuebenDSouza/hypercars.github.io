    <div id="disp2">In the 918 Spyder, Porsche is launching the future of the sportscar: As the first vehicle to boast global road homologation, the model beat the record of seven minutes set for a lap of the Nürburgring Nordschleife, achieving a time of 6:57 minutes.
    The maximum level of performance delivered by the vehicle, namely through its system output of 652 kW (887 hp; combined fuel consumption: 3.1 – 3.0 l/100 km; CO2 emission: 72-70 g/km; Electricity consumption 12.7 kWh/100 km) and minimal consumption figure of three litres per 100 kilometres (NEDC), is the result of a unique plug-in hybrid concept. To meet the driver's requirements, the 918 Spyder exhausts all possibilities offered by the combined drive of combustion engine and electric motor.

</div>
   <div id="disp3">The dynamic performance of the 918 is possible courtesy of the unique all-wheel drive concept with a combined combustion engine and electric motor drive system on the rear axle and a second electric motor on the front axle. This concept is based on Porsche's motorsport development work for the successful 911 GT3 R hybrid.  </div>
