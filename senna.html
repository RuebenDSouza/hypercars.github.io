    <div id="disp2">It is the most track-focused road car we have ever built, and it will set the fastest lap times of any McLaren to date. That is what has driven us to build a track car that is unashamedly without compromise. One that is legalised for road use, but not sanitised to suit it. Nothing else matters but to deliver the most intense driving experience around a circuit.

Inspired by one of McLaren’s greatest racing drivers, the McLaren Senna is utterly dedicated to allowing the driver to be the best they can possibly be.

   <div id="disp3">The level of performance on offer from the McLaren Senna is self-evident from the numbers. The figures only tell part of the story because, from the genesis of the McLaren Senna’s development, there has been an overwhelming drive to reflect the innate feel that Ayrton Senna experienced with his race cars. Without this, the blistering performance cannot be exploited.

The McLaren Senna is the fastest McLaren road car ever around a racetrack, but these abilities go hand-in-hand with an intensely involving and immersive experience that puts the driver utterly in control. </div>
