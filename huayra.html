    <div id="disp2">Ludicrous in every way and utterly fascinating in every gorgeous detail, this is a 720-hp, mid-engined, million-dollar supercar for those who have grown bored with mere Ferraris and Lamborghinis and already have two Bugattis. Somewhat obscure, and very low production, it’s a hard-core machine for discriminating connoisseurs with sufficient liquidity. Brilliantly quick, tenacious on any surface, and almost freakishly aggressive, it’s a car that beautifully warps the minds of the world’s youth.

   <div id="disp3">Powered by a 6.0-liter AMG V12, the Huayra Roadster BC pumps out a monstrous 800 horsepower (596 kilowatts) and 774 pound-feet of torque. That's a modest improvement of 50 hp (37 hp) and 36 lb-ft over the BC Coupe, which makes "just" 750 hp (560 kW) and 738 lb-ft comparatively from its V12. All that additional oomph transfers to the rear wheels via a seven-speed Xtrac sequential gearbox with a lightweight single clutch. The single-clutch setup, Pagani notes, is 35-percent lighter than the usual dual-clutch. That – plus lots of other impressive engineering feats – helps keep the curb weight to a relatively light 2,685 pounds (1,217 kilograms).</div>
