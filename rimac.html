    <div id="disp2">Electric motors offer numerous advantages compared to combustion engines. The Concept_One was designed from the ground-up to utilise those advantages and create a whole new breed – the supercar of the 21st century.

Rimac Automobili’s unique powertrain is divided into four sub-systems. Each system consists of a separate electric powertrain with an independent inverter, motor and gearbox for each wheel of the car. This engineering masterpiece enables us to control each wheel independently, hundreds of times each second, in both directions, delivering an unforgettable driving experience.

   <div id="disp3">The ambitious goal we set ourselves was to produce as much as possible in-house. Painstaking attention to every detail requires high quality, which can best be maintained and controlled if the engineering and manufacturing teams are under the same roof.

Thousands of metal, electric and carbon fibre parts have to be manufactured, assembled and tested for each Concept_One. Even the tools, jigs and moulds are designed and produced by Rimac Automobili. Most of the parts start their lives as aluminium blocks or raw bare carbon fabrics which don't leave the Rimac facilities in Sveta Nedelja before they are assembled into cars.</div>
